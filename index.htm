All outdoor areas have been changed to a more northern environment, and Christmas is celebrated in each town. The new areas were designed for running the game in 3d mod but they will look just fine in 2d also, just some special light effects will be missing. Below are a few screenshots and details of each region of
            Sanctuary.</td></tr><tr><td width="100%" colspan="2">The <b>skill system</b> is greatly simplified, no prerequisites, all character skills are available at level 1. Each Character has 13 skills, some old some new. The new skills are naturally  winter themed for the
            occasion.</td></tr><tr><td width="1%"><a href="pics/Famine_Mag_colossusBlade.jpg"><img border="0" src="pics/Famine_Mag_colossusBlade_thumb.jpg" title="Click to view bigger image" width="160" height="120"></a></td><td width="105%">The mod does not remove any of the original items we are used to, new things were added, drops are balanced differently, some old features can be used in new ways. Some other item effecting changes are cube size is increased, this opens up new doors in cubing, rune words work in magic items. Image to the left shows one of Santa's new goodies, yes rune words do work in magic
            items.</td></tr><tr><td width="100%" colspan="2"><b>A series of Christmas themed sub quests have been added to all
            acts:</b><br> I wont go in to details as that would ruin the surprise but here are some info:<br> In the first act you will be looking for ingredients to prepare a Christmas
            meal. Hint Check out the Turkey Den in Blood More In the second act your looking for
            potions, in third you will find a clue in the spider cavern that clears some things out. In the fourth act look for a Christmas
            tree, when you find it you will know what to do in the fifth act.<br>Once you completed all sub
            quests, here is a hint - Your great end reward is character level dependant and the power is randomized so doing all the quests more than once will be worth it.</td></tr><tr><td width="100%" colspan="2"><b>Credits:</b>
